(** Tweaking OCaml builtin euclidean division

The OCaml built-in euclidian divisions operations do not follow the
standard mathematical conventions. We adapt OCaml available
primitives to suit maths conventions.

(** Sign function
    @param x integer
*)
let sign x =
  if x>= 0 then 1
  else -1;;

(** Quotient of an integer by a natural number.
    This is the quotient in euclidiant division sense.
    @param a dividend
    @param b natural number you divide by.

let quot a b= if b = 0 then
                failwith "Error : Division by 0 (cannot be done)"

                a/b-1

(** Quotient of two integers. Fully Recursive.
    General case ; explicit by-hand computations. Not efficient enough as
    it is not a low level implementation.
*)

(** Modulo of two integers.
    Following euclidean division NOT OCAML DEFAULT. Positive integer
    between 0 (included) and modulo (excluded) resulting from euclidian
    division of entry by modulo.

    OCAML DEFAULT : For negative numbers eucldean result - modulo base.

    @param a input integer
    @param b moduli integer.
 *)
let modulo a b = a - (quot a b)*b;;

(** Division of an integer by a natural number. NOT OCAML DEFAULT.
    Division of an integer by a non-zero integer b is the unique couple
    of integers (q, r) such that a = b*q + r and r is in [0, abs b[.
    @param a dividend
    @param b integer you divide by.
*)
let div a b = (quot a b, modulo a b);;
